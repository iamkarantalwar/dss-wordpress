Cirrhosis of the liver is a chronic disease in which cells are destroyed and scarring takes place in hepatic tissues as a result of the inflammatory process. Cirrhosis is an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in more developed countries, being the 14th most common cause of death worldwide but fourth in central Europe. The two older theories of ascites formation, the underfill theory [ 2] and the overflow theory [ 3 ], appear to be relevant at different stages of the natural history of cirrhosis [ 4 ]. We . systemic viral disease that primarily affects the liver A: formally known as infectious hepatitis B: formally known as serum hepatitis C, D, E, G. Hepatitis A. can be found in the feces, bile, and sera of infected individuals usually transmitted by the FO route The virus causes persistent infection, chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and immune complex disease. Pathogenesis of cirrhosis according to cause. This peculiar transformation of the liver was identified by the first anatomic pathologist, Gianbattista Morgagni in his 500 autopsies published in 1761 but the name of &quot;cirrhosis&quot; (greek=orange color) was given by Laennec in 1826 because of the yellowish-tan color of the cirrhotic liver. Liver microcirculatory dysfunction is one of the key mechanisms that promotes the progression of chronic liver…. Micronodular cirrhosis corresponds to liver parenchyma in which almost all nodules are smaller than 3 mm. With each injury, the liver forms scar tissue (fibrosis), initially without losing its function. Cirrhosis is characterized by fibrosis and nodule formation of the liver, secondary to a chronic injury, which leads to alteration of the normal lobular organization of the liver. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common chronic liver disease in the United States, is a heterogeneous disorder. However, only those patients with localized disease are surgical candidates. Laboratory. Although many pathogenic processes have been implicated in the development of abdominal ascites, about 75% likely occur as a result of portal hypertension in the setting of liver .

Microscopically, the liver is composed of two main cell types, parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells ( Trefts et al., 2017 ). Fatty liver is the accumulation of triglycerides and other fats in the liver cells. In many clinical practices, there . A role for toxic oxygen radicals in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver injury has also been suggested and the demonstration that patients with cirrhosis are more likely to generate greater amounts of oxygen radicals following ethanol exposure as a result of genetic polymorphisms supports this hypothesis (Naassila et al., 2002). Pathophysiology. Hepatic microcirculation and mechanisms of portal hypertension. Only in 1930, one hundred years later . Complete loss of normal architecture, 3. It has a high mortality rate. Most chronic liver disease is notoriously asymptomatic until cirrhosis with clinical decompensation occurs. Study Description. Fig. Treatment depends on the cause of cirrhosis and how much damage exists. Participating in a clinical trial is a great way to contribute to curing, preventing and treating liver disease and its complications. Increasingly, cirrhosis has been seen to be not a single disease entity, but one that can be subclassified into distinct clinical prognostic stages, with 1-year mortality ranging from 1% to 57% depending on the stage. Pathology MACRONODULAR CIRRHOSIS • Large nodules • Often seen following hepatitis B infection Cirrhosis with complicatons of encephalopathy, ascites or variceal haemorrhage - DECOMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS • Cirrhosis without any of these complications - COMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS Clinical subclassification of cirrhosis uses blood with or without clinical parameters. Progression of liver disease over an ill-defined period of time causes advanced liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and, in some cases, hepatocellular carcinoma. Pathogenesis of cirrhosis based upon the underlying cause is as follows: Alcoholic liver disease: Alcohol seems to injure the liver by blocking the normal metabolism of protein, fats, and carbohydrates. For cirrhosis, the biliary channels become obstructed and caused portal hypertension. Pathogenesis. Can be used for staging prior to consideration of liver transplantation. The gross anatomy of the liver with biliary tract, gallbladder, and vascular supply by the portal vein and hepatic artery.
